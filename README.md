# FallingBlocks
An assignment in a second year video game development class, made in C++ using SFML.

This game uses frame limiting within a simple game loop design to keep the framerate fairly constant.

Controls:
Left & Right arrows - movement
Space - hold to activate slow motion
Enter - restarts the game after you die
